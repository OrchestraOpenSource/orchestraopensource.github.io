Keep the software and code as simple and small as possible.\r\n2. Do not create/implement new features till you get all bugs fixed.\r\n3. Test, test, test, test and test a new feature before making  a stable version, stable means stable! Stable is something that just works.\r\n4. More guidelines to come.\r\n\r\n## Current Projects:\r\n* We just started a new project. It's called **Orchestra Browser**, [Orchestra Browser](https://github.com/OrchestraOpenSource/OrchestraBrowser)) is a fork of [Otter Browser](http://otter-browser.org/)). Otter Browser is a really neat [Open Source project](https://github.com/Emdek/otter)) that aims to implement the fantastic User Interface of Opera 12.x using Qt5 and it's all Open Source.
